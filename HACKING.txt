Please attack Phreebird.  I'm serious, nothing would be better than having six 
critical vulnerabilities found in the first week.

Better the first week than the first month, better the first month than the 
first year, and better the first year than our standard operating procedure of 
taking half a decade to realize there's a problem!

Here's what I know is wrong thus far.

KNOWN BUGS:

1) Phreebird leaks memory over time, mainly because LDNS wasn't really designed
to allow lots of very complicated transforms.  I'm working on fixing this,
but as is, Phreebird will leak memory under even mild DoS conditions.
Obviously that's a production blocking bug.

2) Phreebird now has a maximum size for the cache -- 10*1024 buckets, with a 
maximum of 50 entries per bucket.  Theoretically, that's around 500,000 cache 
entries, which at 1K a piece might be 500MB.  It'd probably be a good idea to 
make that tunable.

3) Phreebird doesn't correctly reflect EDNS0 maximum packet size data, though 
it should *respect* the maximum size the user wants to receive.

4) Phreebird doesn't correctly support backend domains that aren't two labels, 
i.e. foo.co.uk.  This will be fixed as soon as I actually get access to such a 
domain.

5) Phreebird, as a UDP proxy, does cause the backend server to lose context on 
what IP it's talking to.  So one of the big advantages of the Phreebird 
approach -- that you can sign any answer -- is sort of impacted.  See source 
code for details on how this will be fixed.

6) Phreebird does not yet support delegation, i.e. scenarios where the backend
name server itself has a DS record for a domain.

7) Should probably not have arbitrary NSEC3 keytag of 1290

8) I don't think I'm merging adjacent sub-TXT records.

9) Something is causing corrupt packets to be returned every so often, a la:

Don't know what -- could be me, could be ldns.

KNOWN HEEBIE JEEBIES:

1) LDNS makes it really annoying to build certain packets without essentially 
doing string concatenation.  For example:

 snprintf(nsec_descrip, sizeof(nsec_descrip), "%s.%s 0 IN NSEC3 1 0 1 1290 %s %s",
   lhash, shortname_buf->_data, rhash, mask);

Now, there's validation going on in validate name, which is basically 
restricting to a-zA-Z0-9 and making sure there aren't two dots in a row, but 
something hinky coould happen here.

2) LDNS Chasing *looks* like it should be correct, but unlike Unbound Tracing,
it's not actually doing the full DNSSEC negotiation all the way from root.  If
there's going to be a design bug anywhere, it's going to be here.

3) Unbound Tracing is not actually something we want every host on the Internet
doing -- it increases traffic to the root and TLDs substantially.  This is made 
worse by the fact that, even thought the Unbound ctx is being cached, lookups 
against the root keep happening.  If you're wondering why unbound lookups seem 
slow, this is why.  You can speed unbound up substantally by turning off IPv6,
but that causes its own headaches (we need v6).

4) The present design really does push people into hardcoding the DNSSEC root 
key into their apps.  The purists really do want people to be able to cycle 
that key, and there's even an RFC (5011) for doing that.  Epic handwringing, 
inbound.

5) I could use a real configure script.

6) I'm not entirely confident about my handling of TXT records in Phreeload.  
There could straight up be some RCE in here.

KNOWN NOT A BUG:

1) If an attacker can spoof traffic between a Phreebird proxy and its backend, 
he can do truly awful things with relatively few spoofed packets.  There's a 
reason this is warned about during execution.

2) Phreebird doesn't daemonize yet.  I'll build that feature in when I'm 
confident there are no production blockers.

3) No, I'm not using your pet DNSSEC schema yet.  Convince me yours is better, or 
fork my code!
