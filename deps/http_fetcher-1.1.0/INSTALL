INSTALLATION
============
From the main HTTP Fetcher directory, type:
	
	1) ./configure
	2) make
		then, as root...
	3) make install

That's it.  The library should then be located in /usr/local/lib/, and the
header should be in /usr/local/include (unless you specified a different
prefix).

If you don't have root on the machine, you can install the package in your
home directory.  For step 1, do "./configure --prefix=YOUR_PATH" where
YOUR_PATH is the directory under which you'd like to install the package.

To uninstall (from the main http_fetcher source distribution directory), type
	make uninstall
